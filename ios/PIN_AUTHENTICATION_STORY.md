# PIN Authentication Implementation Story

## Epic: iOS PIN Authentication Feature Parity

### Research Findings from Android
- 4-digit PIN stored using PBKDF2 hashing with salt
- Encrypted storage using Android Keystore equivalent
- Failed attempt tracking with 5 attempt limit
- 30-second cooldown after max attempts
- Integration with biometric authentication as fallback

### Acceptance Criteria
✅ User can set a 4-digit PIN during onboarding
✅ PIN is securely stored in iOS Keychain with proper encryption
✅ Failed attempts are tracked (max 5 attempts)
✅ 30-second cooldown enforced after 5 failed attempts
✅ PIN can be used to unlock parental controls
✅ PIN can be changed or removed in settings
✅ Biometric authentication can be used as alternative

### Technical Requirements

#### Security
- Use iOS Keychain Services for secure storage
- Implement PBKDF2 hashing with salt
- Use kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly
- No PIN visible in logs or memory dumps

#### UI/UX
- Number pad interface matching Android design
- Visual feedback for PIN entry (dots)
- Clear error messages for failed attempts
- Countdown timer during cooldown period

#### Architecture
- PINManager class for business logic (< 200 lines)
- PINEntryView for UI (< 150 lines)
- Keychain wrapper for secure storage
- ViewModel for state management

### Implementation Tasks

1. **Core Security (PINManager.swift)**
   - Keychain integration
   - PBKDF2 hashing implementation
   - Salt generation
   - Secure storage/retrieval

2. **UI Components (PINEntryView.swift)**
   - Number pad layout
   - PIN dots display
   - Error state handling
   - Cooldown timer

3. **State Management (PINViewModel.swift)**
   - Attempt tracking
   - Cooldown logic
   - UI state coordination
   - Validation flow

4. **Integration Points**
   - Settings screen PIN setup
   - Parental lock screen validation
   - Biometric fallback handling

### Test Cases
- Set PIN successfully
- Validate correct PIN
- Track failed attempts
- Enforce cooldown period
- Change existing PIN
- Remove PIN
- Keychain persistence

### Success Metrics
- 100% feature parity with Android
- < 100ms PIN validation time
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- Smooth UI animations
