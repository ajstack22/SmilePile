# SmilePile - Iterative Development Template

A photo gallery app for children, built using the Atlas iterative development methodology.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository demonstrates how to build an Android app iteratively, ensuring each step produces working, tested software. It's both:
1. A working photo gallery app for children
2. A template for iterative development methodology

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For AI-Assisted Development

1. Give your AI orchestrator the `atlas/00_Prompt.md`
2. It will build the app iteratively, starting with Iteration 0
3. Each iteration is validated before proceeding

### For Human Developers

Follow the iteration plan in `REQUIREMENTS.md`:

1. **Initialize tracking:**
   ```bash
   python3 atlas/07_SCRIPTS_AND_AUTOMATION/iteration_manager.py start "SmilePile" 8
   ```

2. **Check current status:**
   ```bash
   python3 atlas/07_SCRIPTS_AND_AUTOMATION/iteration_manager.py context
   ```

3. **Validate before proceeding:**
   ```bash
   python3 atlas/07_SCRIPTS_AND_AUTOMATION/iteration_manager.py validate
   ```

4. **Move to next iteration:**
   ```bash
   python3 atlas/07_SCRIPTS_AND_AUTOMATION/iteration_manager.py proceed "Feature complete"
   ```

## 🔄 The Iteration Process

Each iteration follows this pattern:

1. **Build** - Add ONE feature to working code
2. **Test** - Write tests for the new feature
3. **Document** - Update documentation
4. **Validate** - Ensure everything works
5. **Commit** - Save working state
6. **Proceed** - Move to next iteration

## 📋 Iteration Plan

| Iteration | Goal | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| 0 | Display one image | ⏳ Starting |
| 1 | Swipe between images | ⏹️ Pending |
| 2 | Load from folder | ⏹️ Pending |
| 3 | Add categories | ⏹️ Pending |
| 4 | Database integration | ⏹️ Pending |
| 5 | Import photos | ⏹️ Pending |
| 6 | Parent management | ⏹️ Pending |
| 7 | Polish & optimize | ⏹️ Pending |

## 🛠️ Key Tools

### iteration_manager.py
Enforces validation gates between iterations. Won't let you proceed until:
- Code compiles ✅
- Tests pass ✅
- Coverage adequate ✅
- Documentation exists ✅

### context_injector.py
Provides complete context to developers/agents including:
- Current iteration state
- Dependencies
- Test requirements
- Integration points

### doc_aggregator.py
Tracks documentation for:
- Each iteration
- Components
- Architecture

## 📚 Methodology

This project follows the Atlas Iteration Methodology:
- **Always have working software** - Can demo after any iteration
- **Test as you go** - Coverage grows naturally
- **Document as you build** - Stays current
- **Integrate immediately** - No "big bang" integration

## 🎓 Learning from Failure

This approach was developed after a previous attempt that:
- Built database ✅
- Built UI ✅
- Failed to integrate ❌

The iterative approach prevents this by ensuring integration at each step.

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Follow the iteration methodology
2. Each PR should be one complete iteration
3. Must pass validation gates
4. Include tests and documentation
