How Atlas Works

Atlas is an AI-powered development orchestration framework that enforces iterative, test-driven development through validation gates. Instead of building all components separately and hoping they integrate (which often fails), Atlas requires development to proceed through small iterations where each step must compile, pass tests, and be documented before moving forward. The orchestrator (typically an LLM like Claude) spawns specialized AI agents in parallel waves - a PM agent defines requirements, researcher agents investigate approaches, developer agents implement features ON TOP of already-working code, and tester agents validate everything. Critical to Atlas is the iteration_manager script that acts as a gatekeeper, preventing progression until all validation checks pass (build succeeds, tests pass, coverage adequate, documentation exists). This creates a "metronome" effect where the system provides fresh context and instructions at each validation point, ensuring developers always have working software that can be demoed, tested, and built upon - eliminating the "big bang integration" failures that plague traditional development where everything is built in isolation.
