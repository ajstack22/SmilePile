    <h2>Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
    
    <h3>Age Restrictions</h3>
    <p>
      SmilePile is designed for users <strong>ages 13 and older</strong>, or for younger users with parental supervision. We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
    </p>

    <h3>Data Collection from Children</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</strong> Because SmilePile operates entirely on-device with no data transmission:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>No personal information is collected from any users, including children</li>
      <li>No user accounts are created</li>
      <li>No data is sent to our servers</li>
      <li>Parents have complete control over all app data on the device</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Enhanced Parental Rights (2025 FTC Amendments)</h3>
    <p>Under COPPA and recent FTC amendments, parents have the following rights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> All data is stored locally on your device - simply open the app to access it</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> Parents can delete all data by going to Settings → Clear All Data, or by uninstalling the app</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out:</strong> No data collection occurs, so no opt-out is necessary</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Information:</strong> This privacy policy provides complete transparency about our practices</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Parental Consent</h3>
    <p>
      Because SmilePile does not collect any personal information or transmit data off-device, parental consent for data collection is not required. However, we recommend parents:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Review this privacy policy</li>
      <li>Understand that all photos remain on the device</li>
      <li>Supervise children's use of the app</li>
      <li>Use device-level parental controls as appropriate</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    
    <h3>Right to Access Data</h3>
    <p>
      All your data is stored on your device. You can access it anytime by opening the SmilePile app.
    </p>

    <h3>Right to Delete Data</h3>
    <p>
      You can delete all SmilePile data by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Going to Settings → Clear All Data in the app (permanently deletes all app data)</li>
      <li>Uninstalling the app from your device (removes app and all associated data)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Deleting data from SmilePile does not delete photos from your device's photo library - those remain untouched.</p>

    <h3>Right to Export</h3>
    <p>
      Your photos remain in your device's photo library and can be exported using your device's native export features.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>SmilePile retains no data on remote servers.</strong> All data exists only on your device for as long as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The app is installed on your device, OR</li>
      <li>Until you manually delete data via Settings → Clear All Data</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>International Users</h2>
    <p>
      SmilePile operates entirely on-device regardless of your location. No data crosses international borders because no data leaves your device.
    </p>
    <p>
      For users in the European Union, SmilePile's local-only approach means we are not a data controller under GDPR, as no personal data is processed by us.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy</li>
      <li>Significant changes will be announced via app update notes</li>
      <li>Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy</li>
    </ul>
