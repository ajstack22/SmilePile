# üöÄ ATLAS FRAMEWORK PROJECT - CONTEXT INJECTION ACTIVE

## IMPORTANT: This Project Uses Atlas Framework 2.2

This project is equipped with the **Atlas Framework** - an intelligent development workflow system with **automatic context injection** for all development tasks.

### How Atlas Works Here

1. **Automatic Context Detection**: When you spawn agents or work on tasks, the Atlas system automatically provides the right documentation and context based on the task type.

2. **Zero Manual Steps**: You don't need to read files or load context manually - it's injected automatically when you use the Task tool.

3. **Intelligent Task Recognition**: The system detects what you're doing (story creation, bug fixing, development, etc.) and provides appropriate context.

### Atlas Directory Location
```
./atlas/                    # Atlas Framework root
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01_CORE/               # Core standards and prompts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02_WORKFLOWS/          # Development workflows
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03_AGENTS/             # Agent specializations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 07_AUTOMATION/         # Automation scripts including context injector
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 09_STORIES/            # Project stories and requirements
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config/                # Context manifests and mappings
```

### Primary Development Workflow

For ALL development tasks, follow this process:

1. **Story First**: Every change starts with a story
   - Bug fixes need bug stories
   - Features need feature stories
   - Technical debt needs debt stories

2. **Use Atlas Prompts**: Find ready-to-use prompts in `atlas/01_CORE/PROMPTS.md`

3. **Natural Agent Spawning**: Just use Task() normally - context is auto-injected
   ```python
   Task("Create story for [feature]", details, "story-writer")  # Auto-gets story context
   Task("Fix [bug description]", details, "bug-fixer")         # Auto-gets debug context
   Task("Implement [story]", details, "general-purpose")       # Auto-detects needed context
   ```

### Quick Command Reference

**Validate Atlas System**:
```bash
python3 atlas/07_AUTOMATION/task_context_integration.py validate
```

**Test Context Injection**:
```bash
python3 atlas/test_context_injection.py
```

**Check Available Profiles**:
```bash
python3 atlas/07_AUTOMATION/enhanced_context_injector.py list
```

### Context Profiles Available

The following context profiles are automatically selected based on task:

- `story_creation` - Requirements, user stories, epics
- `troubleshooting` - Bug fixing, debugging, error resolution
- `ui_development` - Frontend, components, UX
- `backend_development` - APIs, services, databases
- `testing` - Unit tests, integration tests, E2E
- `code_review` - Quality assessment, feedback
- `deployment` - Releases, rollouts, DevOps
- `documentation` - Guides, API docs, README
- `research` - Investigation, analysis, feasibility
- `orchestration` - Multi-agent coordination

### Feature Modifiers

Automatically detected from task descriptions:
- **Authentication**: auth, login, oauth, jwt, password
- **Performance**: optimize, slow, speed, latency
- **Database**: database, sql, migration, schema
- **Security**: security, encryption, vulnerability
- **API**: api, rest, graphql, endpoint

### Working with Stories

**Find Stories**:
```bash
ls atlas/09_STORIES/features/  # Feature stories
ls atlas/09_STORIES/bugs/      # Bug stories
```

**Story Naming Convention**:
- Features: `ATLAS-XXX-description.md`
- Bugs: `BUG-XXX-description.md`
- Epics: `EPIC-XXX-description.md`

### Development Commands

**Full Feature Delivery** (copy from `atlas/01_CORE/PROMPTS.md`):
```
Deliver the [FEATURE] feature end-to-end using the full Atlas workflow:
Story: atlas/09_STORIES/features/[STORY-FILE]
Execute all phases: Research ‚Üí Story Creation ‚Üí Development ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Deploy-Dev
```

### Critical Context Files

These files contain essential project context:
- `atlas/README.md` - Atlas framework overview
- `atlas/01_CORE/PROMPTS.md` - Copy-paste development prompts
- `atlas/02_WORKFLOWS/00_ORCHESTRATION_PROCESS.md` - How to coordinate work
- `atlas/config/context_manifest.json` - Context configuration
- `atlas/config/agent_context_mapping.yaml` - Agent type mappings

### Performance Expectations

- Context injection: <500ms per agent
- Automatic profile selection: 95% accuracy
- Token efficiency: 50% reduction vs manual
- Cache hit rate: >80% for repeated tasks

### Troubleshooting

If context isn't being injected:
1. Run validation: `python3 atlas/07_AUTOMATION/task_context_integration.py validate`
2. Check agent type is recognized
3. Verify Atlas directory exists at `./atlas/`

### DO NOT SKIP ATLAS

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This project's quality and velocity depend on Atlas Framework. Always:
- Start with stories
- Use Atlas workflows
- Let context injection work automatically
- Follow the established patterns

The Atlas Framework is here to make development faster and more consistent. Trust the process.

# Additional CLAUDE.md Integration Tips

## For Project Maintainers

### Initial Setup (One Time)

After copying Atlas to your project:

1. **Copy Atlas Framework**:
```bash
cp -r /path/to/atlas ./atlas
```

2. **Add to .gitignore** (optional, if you don't want Atlas in repo):
```bash
echo "atlas/" >> .gitignore
```

3. **Create/Update CLAUDE.md**:
```bash
# If CLAUDE.md doesn't exist
cp atlas/01_CORE/CLAUDE_MD_PREAMBLE.md CLAUDE.md

# If CLAUDE.md exists
cat atlas/01_CORE/CLAUDE_MD_PREAMBLE.md > CLAUDE.md.tmp
cat CLAUDE.md >> CLAUDE.md.tmp
mv CLAUDE.md.tmp CLAUDE.md
```

4. **Validate Installation**:
```bash
python3 atlas/test_context_injection.py
```

### Customization Points

You can customize Atlas for your project by editing:

1. **Context Manifest** (`atlas/config/context_manifest.json`):
   - Add project-specific documentation to profiles
   - Adjust token budgets
   - Add new profiles for your domain

2. **Agent Mappings** (`atlas/config/agent_context_mapping.yaml`):
   - Add custom agent types
   - Modify keyword detection rules
   - Add project-specific features

3. **Project Stories** (`atlas/09_STORIES/`):
   - Maintain your project's stories here
   - Follow the naming convention
   - Keep stories up-to-date

### Best Practices

1. **Every Session Starts with Validation**:
   - First command should validate Atlas is working
   - Ensures context injection is operational

2. **Story-Driven Development**:
   - No code without a story
   - Stories provide context for all agents

3. **Trust Automatic Context**:
   - Don't manually specify files to read
   - Let the system detect and inject

4. **Use Specialized Agents**:
   - `story-writer` for requirements
   - `bug-fixer` for issues
   - `ui-developer` for frontend
   - `backend-developer` for APIs
   - Let general-purpose detect from description

### Monitoring Atlas Performance

Track these metrics weekly:
- Story completion rate
- Bug fix turnaround time
- Test coverage trends
- Context injection accuracy
- Agent success rates

### Updating Atlas

To update to a newer Atlas version:
```bash
# Backup current
mv atlas atlas.backup

# Copy new version
cp -r /path/to/new/atlas ./atlas

# Merge custom configurations
cp atlas.backup/config/*.json atlas/config/
cp atlas.backup/config/*.yaml atlas/config/
cp -r atlas.backup/09_STORIES/* atlas/09_STORIES/

# Validate
python3 atlas/test_context_injection.py
```
