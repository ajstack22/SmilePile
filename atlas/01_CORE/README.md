# Atlas Core Framework Components

This directory contains the fundamental standards, agreements, and role definitions that form the foundation of the Atlas Framework.

## Contents

### Standards & Agreements

- Process agreements and workflow definitions
- Quality standards and compliance requirements
- Security and safety protocols

### Role Definitions
- Project Manager role specifications
- Developer role definitions and responsibilities
- Reviewer role requirements and capabilities

## Usage

These core components establish the foundational principles that all other Atlas Framework components build upon. They define:

- **What** we build (standards)
- **How** we build it (processes)
- **Who** builds it (roles)
- **Why** we build it this way (agreements)
