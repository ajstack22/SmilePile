## Test Setup Analysis
- Build system: Gradle with Kotlin DSL
- Test framework: AndroidX Test + Espresso available
- Current test count: 0
- Test directories exist but empty

## Critical User Flows
1. Photo Lifecycle:
   - Add from gallery
   - Assign categories
   - View in modes
   - Remove from library

2. Kids Mode Safety:
   - Settings blocked
   - Deletion blocked
   - Management blocked

3. Data Persistence:
   - Photos survive restart
   - Categories persist
   - Mode state maintained

## Deployment Best Practices
- Use gradlew assembleRelease for APK
- Use gradlew bundleRelease for AAB
- ProGuard/R8 enabled by default
- Signing config needed for release
