# Wave 3: Feature Completion

## Objectives
1. Photo deletion (remove from app library only, keep in MediaStore)
2. Local export (JSON backup of metadata + categories)
3. Local import (restore from JSON backup)
4. Clean up high-priority TODOs

## Key Principles
- Photos are NEVER deleted from MediaStore
- Local-only, no cloud sync
- Simple JSON format
- No undo needed
