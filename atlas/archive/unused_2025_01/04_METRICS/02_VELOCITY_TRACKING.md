# Atlas Velocity Tracking System v2.0

## Overview

The Atlas Velocity Tracking System provides comprehensive metrics to measure and optimize team performance across multiple dimensions. This system goes beyond simple story point tracking to include quality-adjusted velocity, predictability metrics, and continuous improvement indicators.

## Core Velocity Metrics

### 1. Traditional Velocity Metrics

#### Story Point Velocity
**Definition**: Story points completed per sprint
**Calculation**: Sum of story points for all completed stories in a sprint
**Target**: Maintain consistent velocity ±15% sprint-over-sprint

```
Sprint Velocity = Σ(Completed Story Points)
Rolling Average Velocity = (Last 6 Sprints Velocity) / 6
```

#### Feature Delivery Rate
**Definition**: Number of features delivered per sprint
**Calculation**: Count of features marked as "Done" in sprint
**Target**: Minimum 2 features per sprint, trending upward

```
Feature Delivery Rate = Count(Completed Features) / Sprint Duration
```

#### Cycle Time
**Definition**: Time from story creation to production deployment
**Calculation**: Average time across all completed stories
**Target**: <14 days for standard features, <7 days for small features

```
Cycle Time = Deployment Date - Story Creation Date
Average Cycle Time = Σ(Individual Cycle Times) / Count(Stories)
```

### 2. Quality-Adjusted Velocity Metrics

#### Quality-Weighted Velocity
**Definition**: Story points adjusted for quality score
**Calculation**: Story points × (Quality Score / 100)
**Target**: Quality-weighted velocity ≥ 85% of raw velocity

```
Quality-Weighted Velocity = Σ(Story Points × Quality Score / 100)
Quality Adjustment Factor = Quality-Weighted Velocity / Raw Velocity
```

#### Defect-Adjusted Velocity
**Definition**: Story points reduced by defect rework impact
**Calculation**: Original velocity minus defect remediation effort
**Target**: Defect impact <10% of total velocity

```
Defect Impact = Σ(Defect Fix Story Points)
Defect-Adjusted Velocity = Sprint Velocity - Defect Impact
Defect Rate = Defect Impact / Sprint Velocity
```

#### First-Time-Right Velocity
**Definition**: Story points that required no rework or defect fixes
**Calculation**: Velocity from stories with zero post-completion issues
**Target**: >90% of delivered story points should be first-time-right

```
First-Time-Right Velocity = Σ(Zero-Rework Story Points)
First-Time-Right Rate = First-Time-Right Velocity / Total Velocity
```

### 3. Predictability Metrics

#### Velocity Variance
**Definition**: Standard deviation of sprint velocities
**Calculation**: Statistical variance across recent sprints
**Target**: Coefficient of variation <20%

```
Velocity Variance = σ(Sprint Velocities)
Coefficient of Variation = (Velocity Variance / Mean Velocity) × 100
```

#### Commitment Reliability
**Definition**: Percentage of sprint commitments successfully delivered
**Calculation**: Completed story points / Committed story points
**Target**: >85% commitment reliability

```
Commitment Reliability = (Completed Points / Committed Points) × 100
Sprint Success Rate = Sprints with >85% Completion / Total Sprints
```

#### Forecast Accuracy
**Definition**: Accuracy of velocity-based delivery predictions
**Calculation**: Predicted vs. actual delivery dates
**Target**: <10% variance in delivery predictions

```
Forecast Error = |Predicted Date - Actual Date| / Predicted Duration
Forecast Accuracy = (1 - Average Forecast Error) × 100
```

### 4. Flow Metrics

#### Work in Progress (WIP)
**Definition**: Number of stories actively being worked
**Calculation**: Count of stories in "In Progress" states
**Target**: WIP limit based on team size (typically 1.5 × team size)

```
Current WIP = Count(Stories in Progress)
WIP Utilization = Current WIP / WIP Limit
```

#### Throughput
**Definition**: Number of stories completed per time period
**Calculation**: Stories completed / time period
**Target**: Consistent throughput aligned with capacity

```
Weekly Throughput = Stories Completed / Week
Monthly Throughput = Stories Completed / Month
```

#### Flow Efficiency
**Definition**: Percentage of cycle time spent on value-adding work
**Calculation**: Active work time / total cycle time
**Target**: >25% flow efficiency

```
Flow Efficiency = (Active Work Time / Total Cycle Time) × 100
Wait Time = Total Cycle Time - Active Work Time
```
