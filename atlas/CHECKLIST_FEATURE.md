# Atlas Context Checklist Feature

## Overview
The Atlas Framework now includes automatic verification checklists that are injected alongside context for each task profile. This ensures quality gates and verification steps are always present when agents work on tasks.

## Feature Implementation

### Components Added

1. **Checklist Configuration** (`06_CHECKLISTS/CONTEXT_CHECKLISTS.yaml`)
   - 9 profile-specific checklists (story_creation, troubleshooting, ui_development, etc.)
   - Each checklist contains required and optional verification items
   - Structured format for consistent presentation

2. **Enhanced Context Injector Updates**
   - Added `_load_checklists()` method to load YAML configuration
   - Added `_format_checklist()` method to format checklists as markdown
   - Integrated checklist content into `build_context()` method
   - Minimal performance impact (< 0.1ms overhead)

3. **Task Context Integration Updates**
   - Passes `checklist_included` metadata through to task parameters
   - Exposes injector for testing purposes

## Benefits

### 1. Quality Assurance
- **Automatic Verification**: Every task gets relevant quality checks
- **Consistency**: Same standards applied across all work
- **No Manual Steps**: Checklists are automatically included

### 2. Task-Specific Guidance
Each profile has tailored verification items:
- **Story Creation**: 9 required checks for proper formatting
- **Bug Fixing**: Root cause and regression test requirements
- **UI Development**: Accessibility and responsive design checks
- **Backend**: API design and security verification
- **Testing**: Coverage and edge case requirements

### 3. Performance
- **Minimal Overhead**: < 0.1ms addition to injection time
- **Cached Loading**: Checklists loaded once and reused
- **Token Efficient**: Adds ~200-400 tokens per context

## Usage

### Automatic Injection
When agents are spawned, checklists are automatically included:
```python
Task("Create auth story", details, "story-writer")
# Automatically gets story creation checklist
```

### Checklist Format
Checklists appear in the context as markdown:
```markdown
## ✅ Verification Checklist
**Story Creation Checklist**
_Ensure stories meet Atlas quality standards_

### Required Checks:
- [ ] User story follows 'As a... I want... So that...' format
- [ ] Acceptance criteria use Given/When/Then format
...

### Optional Checks:
- [ ] Dependencies on other stories/systems identified
```

## Testing

### Test Coverage
Created comprehensive test suite (`test_checklist_injection.py`):
1. ✅ Checklist formatting validation
2. ✅ Checklist inclusion in context
3. ✅ Agent receives checklist
4. ✅ Profile-specific checklist verification
5. ✅ Performance impact measurement

### Test Results
- **All tests passing**: 5/5 ✅
- **Performance**: 0.0ms overhead (negligible)
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing system

## Configuration

### Adding/Modifying Checklists
Edit `06_CHECKLISTS/CONTEXT_CHECKLISTS.yaml`:
```yaml
checklists:
  new_profile:
    name: "New Profile Checklist"
    description: "Description of checklist purpose"
    items:
      - id: "check_1"
        check: "Description of what to verify"
        required: true
```

### Disabling Checklists
To disable for specific profiles, remove from YAML or set empty items list.

## Integration Points

1. **Enhanced Context Injector**: Loads and formats checklists
2. **Task Context Integration**: Includes in agent prompts
3. **Context Manifest**: Works alongside existing file injection

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Dynamic checklist generation based on task analysis
2. Checklist completion tracking and reporting
3. Custom checklist templates per project
4. Integration with git hooks for enforcement
5. Checklist analytics and optimization

## Summary

The checklist feature provides:
- ✅ Automatic quality gates for all development tasks
- ✅ Zero configuration required - works out of the box
- ✅ Negligible performance impact (< 0.1ms)
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Easy customization via YAML configuration

This enhancement ensures consistent quality standards across all Atlas-powered development work.
