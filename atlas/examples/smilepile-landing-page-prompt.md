# Atlas Workflow Prompt: SmilePile Landing Page & Legal Documentation Site

## ðŸ”§ WORKFLOW DIRECTIVE: USE ATLAS AGENT-DRIVEN WORKFLOW

**MANDATORY:** This project MUST follow the **9-Phase Atlas Agent-Driven Workflow** as defined in `/Users/adamstack/SmilePile/atlas/docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`

Execute all phases using specialized agents:
- **Phase 1:** Research (general-purpose agent)
- **Phase 2:** Story Creation (product-manager agent)
- **Phase 3:** Planning (developer agent)
- **Phase 4:** Security Review (security + peer-reviewer agents in parallel)
- **Phase 5:** Implementation (developer agent)
- **Phase 6:** Testing (peer-reviewer + general-purpose agents in parallel)
- **Phase 7:** Validation (product-manager agent)
- **Phase 8:** Clean-up (general-purpose agent)
- **Phase 9:** Deployment (devops agent)

**DO NOT skip phases. DO NOT modify the workflow. Follow Atlas methodology exactly.**

## Project Context

**What:** Create a professional landing page for SmilePile.app that serves as:
1. Marketing/informational site for the mobile apps
2. Host for legal documents (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service)
3. Support/contact information hub
4. App download links (App Store, Google Play)

**Why:** The SmilePile iOS and Android apps link to `https://smilepile.app/?privacy`, `https://smilepile.app/?tos`, and `mailto:support@stackmap.app`. We need a functional website to serve these pages and provide app information.

**Current State:**
- Domain: smilepile.app (owned, not yet configured)

- Company: StackMap (developer/publisher)
- No existing website infrastructure
