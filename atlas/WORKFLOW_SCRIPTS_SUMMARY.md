# Atlas Workflow Scripts - Complete System

## ‚úÖ Scripts Created

### Master Orchestrator
- **`atlas_workflow.py`** - Complete 7-phase workflow with checkpoints
  - Research ‚Üí Story ‚Üí Planning ‚Üí Adversarial ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Validation
  - Forces confirmation after each phase
  - Prevents skipping ahead or coding too early

### Support Scripts
- **`atlas_adversarial.py`** - Adversarial review checklist
  - Finds edge cases and missed requirements
  - Checks all layout variants
  - Forces thorough quality review

- **`atlas_checkpoint.py`** - Checkpoint management
  - Provides confirmation prompts
  - Guides LLM on how to ask for approval
  - Ensures user stays in control

- **`atlas_research.py`** - Research phase guide
  - Ensures thorough investigation
  - Prevents assumptions
  - Documents findings

- **`atlas_story.py`** - Story creation templates
  - Provides proper story format
  - Includes all required sections
  - Different templates for bugs vs features

### Documentation
- **`WORKFLOW_USAGE.md`** - How to use the new system
- **`WORKFLOW_SCRIPTS_SUMMARY.md`** - This file

## üì¶ Archived Scripts

Moved to `atlas/archive/old_operators/`:
- `atlas_bug_workflow.py` - Old bug workflow
- `fix_bug.py` - Old bug fixer
- `create_feature.py` - Old feature creator
- `atlas_enforce.py` - Old enforcement mode
- `atlas_guided.py` - Old guided mode

## üéØ The Single Command You Need

```bash
python3 atlas/atlas_workflow.py feature "Your feature description"
```

or

```bash
python3 atlas/atlas_workflow.py bug "Your bug description"
```

## üöÄ Example for Your Categories Menu

```
I need to modify the categories screen: Remove FAB, add 3-dot menu with Import Mode and Cancel.

Run:
python3 atlas/atlas_workflow.py feature "Replace FAB with 3-dot menu on categories screen"

Follow all 7 phases. Ask me for confirmation after each phase.
Do NOT skip ahead. Do NOT code until Phase 5.
```

## ‚ú® Key Improvements

1. **Single unified workflow** - One command for everything
2. **Forced checkpoints** - LLM must ask for confirmation
3. **Phase separation** - Can't jump to coding
4. **Adversarial review** - Built-in quality gate
5. **Clear progression** - 7 phases in strict order
6. **User control** - You approve each phase

## üîÑ Workflow Phases

1. **RESEARCH** - Investigate thoroughly
2. **STORY** - Document everything
3. **PLANNING** - Detail the approach
4. **ADVERSARIAL** - Find what's missing
5. **IMPLEMENTATION** - Finally write code
6. **TESTING** - Verify it works
7. **VALIDATION** - Confirm completion

## üìù What Changed

### Before (Old System):
- Multiple scripts for different scenarios
- Focused on context injection
- LLMs would skip steps
- Hard to keep on track

### After (New System):
- One workflow to rule them all
- Checkpoints enforce compliance
- Clear phases prevent skipping
- User maintains control
- Adversarial review catches issues

## üí° Remember

The key to keeping LLMs on track is:
1. **Clear phases** they can't skip
2. **Mandatory confirmations** after each phase
3. **No code until Phase 5** (after planning and review)
4. **You control progression** with yes/no responses

This system turns the LLM from a "problem solver" into a "process follower" who asks for your approval at each step.
