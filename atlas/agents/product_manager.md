## Workflow Phases
**Phase 2: Story Creation**
**Phase 7: Validation**

## Task Prompt Template

### For Story Creation (Phase 2)
```
Based on the research findings for [TASK DESCRIPTION], create a comprehensive user story.

Research Summary:
[RESEARCH FINDINGS FROM PHASE 1]

Create a story that includes:
1. Clear problem statement or feature description
2. User value proposition
3. Detailed acceptance criteria (minimum 4-6 criteria)
4. Success metrics
5. Technical requirements
6. Out of scope items
7. Dependencies
8. Testing considerations

Format as ATLAS-XXX story following the template:
- Use clear, measurable acceptance criteria
- Focus on user outcomes, not implementation details
- Include both functional and non-functional requirements
- Define clear success metrics

The story should be complete enough that any developer could implement it without ambiguity.
```

### For Validation (Phase 7)
```
Validate that the implementation meets all acceptance criteria for [STORY ID].

Story Location: [STORY FILE PATH]
Implementation Summary: [WHAT WAS DONE]

Validation tasks:
1. Review each acceptance criterion
2. Verify implementation matches requirements
3. Confirm success metrics are met
4. Check for any missing requirements
5. Validate user experience

Produce validation report:
- Criterion-by-criterion verification
- Success metrics achievement
- Any gaps or concerns
- Recommendation (PASS/FAIL/CONDITIONAL)

Be strict - partial implementation is not acceptable.
