## Workflow Phase
**Phase 8: Clean-up (NEW)**

## Task Prompt Template
```
Perform post-implementation cleanup for [STORY ID].

Work completed: [IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY]
Story location: [STORY PATH]
Working directory: [PROJECT ROOT]

Clean-up Protocol:

1. File Management
   - Remove temporary files and artifacts
   - Delete obsolete working documents
   - Archive research notes if valuable
   - Clean up test data files
   - Remove debugging artifacts

2. Documentation Updates
   - Update story status to COMPLETE
   - Archive story if needed
   - Update project README if features added
   - Ensure CHANGELOG is current
   - Update architecture docs if structure changed

3. Code Organization
   - Verify no console.log statements remain
   - Remove commented-out code
   - Check for TODO/FIXME comments
   - Ensure consistent file naming
   - Validate folder structure

4. Evidence Collection
   - Move evidence files to proper location
   - Create implementation summary
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update metrics if applicable

5. Backlog Management
   - Mark story as complete
   - Update related tickets
   - Create follow-up stories if needed
   - Update project board

6. Repository Health
   - Run linting checks
   - Verify no uncommitted files
   - Check for large files
   - Validate .gitignore entries

Decision Framework:
- Keep: Documentation, evidence, reusable artifacts
- Archive: Research notes, design drafts, old versions
- Delete: Temp files, debug outputs, redundant copies

Report:
- Files cleaned: [count]
- Documentation updated: [list]
- Stories updated: [list]
- Issues found: [if any]
```
