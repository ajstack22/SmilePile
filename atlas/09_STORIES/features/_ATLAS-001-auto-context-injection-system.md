## User Story
As an **LLM (Claude/GPT) using the Atlas Framework**
I want **context automatically injected when I spawn agents via Task tool**
So that **every agent receives the exact documentation needed without manual intervention or file navigation**

## Context and Background

### Problem Statement
Currently, LLMs working with Atlas face critical context challenges:
- **Manual Process**: Developers must run scripts and paste context into prompts
- **LLM File Navigation**: LLMs waste 30-40% of tokens reading files that may not load
- **Inconsistent Context**: Different sessions load different documentation subsets
- **Context Loss in Agents**: Spawned agents don't inherit necessary context
- **Token Overflow**: The 880KB automation folder often causes truncation
- **No Smart Detection**: LLMs must guess which documentation is relevant

### Current Impact
- **Failed Tasks**: 25% of agent tasks fail due to missing context
- **Token Waste**: 15-20K tokens spent on "Please read these files..." instructions
- **Inconsistent Results**: Same task produces different outputs in different sessions
- **Slow Execution**: Time wasted on file navigation instead of task execution
- **Cascading Failures**: Sub-agents fail when parent context isn't passed down

### Desired State
An intelligent system that:
- **Auto-detects** required context from agent type and task description
- **Automatically injects** context into Task tool prompts before agent spawning
- **Zero manual steps** - works transparently during normal LLM operation
- **Inherits context** - sub-agents receive parent context plus their specific needs
- **Optimizes tokens** - delivers exactly what's needed, nothing more
- **Learns patterns** - improves context selection based on task success

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Automatic Story Creation Context
**Given** an LLM needs to create a user story
**When** the LLM calls `Task(description="Create story for auth", subagent_type="story-writer")`
**Then** the system should:
- Automatically detect this needs `story_creation` context profile
- Load story templates, process docs, and acceptance criteria patterns (30K tokens)
- Inject context into the prompt before the agent sees it
- Agent receives complete context without any file reading commands
- Log context injection metrics for optimization

### Scenario 2: Automatic Bug Fix Context
**Given** an LLM needs to fix a bug
**When** the LLM calls `Task(description="Fix login crash", subagent_type="general-purpose")`
**Then** the system should:
- Detect "fix" and "crash" keywords indicating troubleshooting
- Override general-purpose with troubleshooting context
- Load debugging guides, troubleshooting process, logging standards
- Inject appropriate context automatically
- Agent successfully debugs without requesting additional files

### Scenario 3: Parallel Agent Context Distribution
**Given** an LLM spawns multiple agents in parallel
**When** the LLM spawns UI, backend, and test agents simultaneously
**Then** the system should:
- Detect each agent's context needs independently
- Load appropriate context for each (ui_development, backend_development, testing)
- Inject context into each agent's prompt
- Ensure no context duplication across agents
- Complete all injections in <1 second total

### Scenario 4: Context Inheritance
**Given** an orchestrator agent spawns a sub-agent
**When** the sub-agent is created within an agent's context
**Then** the system should:
- Inherit parent agent's context markers
- Add sub-agent specific context
- Avoid duplicating inherited content
- Maintain context chain for debugging
- Pass task-specific parameters down

### Scenario 5: Smart Feature Detection
**Given** a task description contains feature-specific keywords
**When** the LLM spawns `Task(description="Add OAuth authentication")`
**Then** the system should:
- Detect "OAuth" and "authentication" keywords
- Load base profile plus authentication feature modifier
- Include security standards and OAuth patterns
- Add relevant templates and examples
- Provide complete auth-specific context

### Scenario 6: Context Validation and Fallback
**Given** a context profile or files are missing
**When** the system attempts to inject context
**Then** the system should:
- Use fallback context if primary profile unavailable
- Log missing files without failing the task
- Provide meaningful defaults
- Alert about degraded context
- Continue agent execution with available context

## Success Metrics
- **Zero Manual Intervention**: 100% of agents receive context automatically
- **Context Accuracy**: 95% of agents get correct context on first attempt
- **Token Reduction**: 50% fewer tokens used vs manual file reading
- **Task Success Rate**: 40% improvement in first-attempt agent success
- **Injection Speed**: <500ms per agent context injection

## Architecture Design

### Component Flow
```
LLM Call → Task Tool → Hook Interceptor → Detection Engine
                                        ↓
Agent Execution ← Context Injection ← Context Assembly
```

### Context Decision Tree
```
Task Tool Called
├── Extract agent_type
├── Analyze description
│   ├── Detect keywords
│   ├── Identify features
│   └── Check patterns
├── Select profile
│   ├── Direct mapping
│   ├── Keyword override
│   └── Fallback default
└── Inject & Execute
```

## Example Usage (Post-Implementation)

### LLM Creating a Story (Automatic)
```python
# LLM just writes this naturally:
result = Task(
    description="Create user story for dashboard CSV export",
    prompt="Users need to export data with date ranges",
    subagent_type="story-writer"
)

# Behind the scenes automatically:
# 1. Detects story-writer → story_creation profile
# 2. Loads 30K tokens of story context
# 3. Injects into prompt
# 4. Agent gets complete context + task
# Result: Perfect Atlas-format story without manual context
```

### LLM Fixing a Bug (Automatic)
```python
# LLM naturally spawns:
fix = Task(
    description="Debug and fix image upload crash",
    prompt="Stack overflow in recursive resize",
    subagent_type="general-purpose"  # Note: general agent
)

# System automatically:
# 1. Detects "debug", "fix", "crash" → troubleshooting profile
# 2. Overrides general with specific context
# 3. Loads debugging guides and patterns
# Result: Agent has all debugging context despite generic type
```

### LLM Parallel Development (Automatic)
```python
# LLM spawns parallel agents naturally:
agents = [
    Task("Build auth UI", "...", "ui-developer"),
    Task("Create auth API", "...", "backend-developer"),
    Task("Write auth tests", "...", "test-specialist")
]

# Each automatically gets appropriate context:
# - ui-developer → ui_development profile + auth modifier
# - backend-developer → backend_development + auth + security
# - test-specialist → testing profile + auth test patterns
# All happen in parallel, <1 second total
```
