# ATLAS-001: Rework image display to show only photos maximized to screen with swipe navigation, no UI elements

## Status: READY

## User Story
**As a** user viewing photos
**I want** Rework image display to show only photos maximized to screen with swipe navigation, no UI elements
**So that** I can have an optimal photo viewing experience

## Feature Details
- **Type**: UI Enhancement
- **Area**: UI
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Created**: 2025-09-20T11:16:37.889045

## Current State
[Describe current implementation that needs to be changed]

## Desired State
Rework image display to show only photos maximized to screen with swipe navigation, no UI elements

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
**GIVEN** I am on the photo display screen
**WHEN** I view a photo
**THEN** the photo should take maximum screen space based on its resolution

**GIVEN** a photo is displayed
**WHEN** I swipe left
**THEN** the next photo should animate in from the right

**GIVEN** a photo is displayed
**WHEN** I swipe right
**THEN** the previous photo should animate in from the left

**GIVEN** the photo display screen
**WHEN** it loads
**THEN** no UI elements should be visible (no buttons, text, or overlays)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Swipe gestures respond within 100ms
- [ ] Photo transitions complete within 300ms
- [ ] Images maintain aspect ratio
- [ ] No image quality degradation
- [ ] Smooth 60fps animations

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Details
- **Framework**: [TBD based on current stack]
- **Gesture Library**: [TBD]
- **Image Loading**: Progressive loading with caching
- **Animation**: Hardware-accelerated transitions

### Architecture Changes
- Remove all UI overlay components
- Implement gesture recognizer
- Create photo scaling algorithm
- Add transition animation controller

## Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: Time spent viewing photos increases by 30%
- **Performance**: All transitions at 60fps
- **Responsiveness**: Gesture response time < 100ms
- **Quality**: Zero image distortion reports

## Risk Analysis

### Risks
1. **Gesture Conflicts**: May conflict with system gestures
   - *Mitigation*: Test on all target devices

2. **Image Memory**: Large images may cause memory issues
   - *Mitigation*: Implement intelligent caching

3. **Accessibility**: No UI means no accessibility labels
   - *Mitigation*: Add voice-over support for swipes

## Testing Requirements

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Test with various image resolutions
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes
- [ ] Test gesture responsiveness
- [ ] Test animation smoothness
- [ ] Test memory usage with large galleries
- [ ] Test edge cases (single photo, empty gallery)

### Device Testing
- [ ] Phone (various sizes)
- [ ] Tablet
- [ ] Different OS versions

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Remove existing carousel component
- [ ] Remove all button components
- [ ] Remove all text overlays
- [ ] Implement swipe gesture recognizer
- [ ] Create photo scaling algorithm
- [ ] Add transition animations
- [ ] Optimize image loading
- [ ] Add progressive image loading
- [ ] Implement image caching
- [ ] Test on all screen sizes
- [ ] Performance profiling
- [ ] Accessibility testing

## Evidence Requirements
- [ ] Before/after screenshots
- [ ] Performance metrics dashboard
- [ ] User testing video
- [ ] Code review approval
- [ ] Test results report
