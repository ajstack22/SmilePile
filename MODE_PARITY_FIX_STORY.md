# Story: Fix Platform Mode Parity and Default State Issues

## Story ID: SMILE-001
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Estimated Points**: 8
**Dependencies**: None
**Platforms**: iOS & Android

## Background

SmilePile has critical platform parity issues that make the app non-functional on iOS and incorrectly configured on Android. The app has two modes:
- **Parent Mode (Edit Mode)**: For parents to manage photos, categories, and settings
- **Kids Mode (View Mode)**: Simplified, safe viewing mode for children

Currently:
- iOS shows a test placeholder instead of the actual Kids Mode
- Android starts in Kids Mode when it should start in Parent Mode
- iOS Parent Mode lacks bottom navigation
- Mode switching behavior is inconsistent between platforms

## User Story

**AS A** parent setting up SmilePile for the first time
**I WANT** the app to start in Parent Mode on both platforms
**SO THAT** I can configure categories and add photos before letting my child use the app

**AND AS A** parent using the app
**I WANT** consistent navigation and mode switching on both iOS and Android
**SO THAT** the experience is predictable regardless of device

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Default Starting Mode
- [ ] **BOTH** iOS and Android MUST start in Parent Mode on fresh install
- [ ] Parent Mode MUST show bottom navigation with Gallery, Categories, and Settings tabs
- [ ] The app MUST NOT require PIN/authentication on first launch
- [ ] Default categories (Family, Cars, Games, Sports) MUST be pre-populated

### AC2: iOS Kids Mode Implementation
- [ ] The eye button in Parent Mode MUST switch to actual Kids Mode (not test page)
- [ ] Kids Mode MUST display the KidsModeGalleryView component
- [ ] Kids Mode MUST show category chips at the top
- [ ] Kids Mode MUST hide bottom navigation
- [ ] Kids Mode MUST have working photo gallery with category filtering
- [ ] Triple-tap in top-right corner MUST trigger PIN entry to exit Kids Mode

### AC3: iOS Parent Mode Navigation
- [ ] Parent Mode MUST show bottom tab bar with three tabs:
  - Gallery (photo icon) - default selected
  - Categories (folder icon)
  - Settings (gear icon)
- [ ] Tab bar MUST be visible on all Parent Mode screens
- [ ] Tab selection MUST persist correct screen state
- [ ] FAB buttons MUST appear above tab bar (z-index issue already fixed)

### AC4: Mode Switching Behavior Alignment
- [ ] Eye button behavior MUST be consistent:
  - From Parent Mode → Enter Kids Mode immediately (no PIN required)
  - From Kids Mode → Require PIN to return to Parent Mode
- [ ] Mode state MUST persist across app restarts
- [ ] Mode transitions MUST be smooth without flashing or layout jumps

### AC5: Platform Feature Parity
- [ ] Both platforms MUST have identical:
  - Starting mode (Parent Mode)
  - Mode switching mechanisms
  - Navigation structure in Parent Mode
  - Kids Mode functionality
  - Category management features
  - Photo management features

## Technical Implementation Details

### iOS Required Changes

1. **Fix Kids Mode View** (`ContentView.swift` line 79-80):
```swift
// REMOVE: KidsModePlaceholderView(viewModel: kidsModeViewModel)
// ADD: KidsModeGalleryView(viewModel: kidsModeViewModel)
```

2. **Ensure KidsModeGalleryView is in Xcode project**:
- Add `/SmilePile/Views/KidsMode/KidsModeGalleryView.swift` to Xcode project
- Verify all Kids Mode components are included in build

3. **Verify Parent Mode starts by default** (`KidsModeViewModel.swift` line 6):
```swift
@Published var isKidsMode = false // Should remain false
```

4. **Fix bottom navigation visibility** in `ParentModeView`:
- Ensure MaterialTabBar is always visible
- Tab bar should have z-index lower than content (already fixed)

### Android Required Changes

1. **Fix default mode** (`ModeManager.kt` lines 26-27):
```kotlin
// CHANGE FROM:
val modeString = prefs.getString("current_mode", AppMode.KIDS.name)
return AppMode.valueOf(modeString ?: AppMode.KIDS.name)

// CHANGE TO:
val modeString = prefs.getString("current_mode", AppMode.PARENT.name)
return AppMode.valueOf(modeString ?: AppMode.PARENT.name)
```

2. **Verify mode switching** maintains consistency with iOS behavior

### Shared Requirements

1. **Mode Persistence**:
- Save mode state to UserDefaults (iOS) / SharedPreferences (Android)
- Load saved mode on app restart
- Default to Parent Mode if no saved state exists

2. **Eye Button Behavior**:
- Parent Mode: Immediate switch to Kids Mode
- Kids Mode: Show PIN dialog for exit
- Visual feedback on button press

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fresh Install
1. Uninstall app completely
2. Install fresh build
3. Launch app
4. **VERIFY**: App starts in Parent Mode with bottom navigation visible
5. **VERIFY**: Gallery tab is selected by default
6. **VERIFY**: Categories show: Family, Cars, Games, Sports

### Scenario 2: Mode Switching - No PIN
1. Start in Parent Mode
2. Tap eye button
3. **VERIFY**: Switches to Kids Mode immediately
4. **VERIFY**: Bottom navigation disappears
5. **VERIFY**: Category chips appear at top
6. Triple-tap top-right corner
7. **VERIFY**: Returns to Parent Mode (no PIN set)

### Scenario 3: Mode Switching - With PIN
1. Set PIN in Settings
2. Navigate to Categories tab
3. Tap eye button
4. **VERIFY**: Switches to Kids Mode
5. Triple-tap top-right corner
6. **VERIFY**: PIN dialog appears
7. Enter correct PIN
8. **VERIFY**: Returns to Parent Mode on Categories tab

### Scenario 4: Navigation Persistence
1. In Parent Mode, navigate to Settings
2. Tap eye button to enter Kids Mode
3. Exit Kids Mode (triple-tap + PIN if set)
4. **VERIFY**: Returns to Settings tab, not Gallery

### Scenario 5: Cross-Platform Verification
1. Perform same actions on iOS and Android
2. **VERIFY**: Identical behavior on both platforms
3. **VERIFY**: Same UI elements in same positions
4. **VERIFY**: Same navigation flow

## Edge Cases to Test

1. **Rapid mode switching**: Tap eye button repeatedly
2. **Background/foreground**: Mode persists after backgrounding app
3. **Memory pressure**: Mode persists after memory warning
4. **Rotation** (tablets): Layout adapts correctly in both modes
5. **Incomplete PIN entry**: Canceling PIN dialog keeps Kids Mode active
6. **No categories**: Both modes handle empty category list gracefully
7. **FAB visibility**: FABs remain above navigation in all scenarios

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All test scenarios pass on both platforms
- [ ] Code reviewed by senior developer
- [ ] No regression in existing features
- [ ] Mode state persists correctly
- [ ] Performance: Mode switch < 300ms
- [ ] Accessibility: VoiceOver/TalkBack works in both modes
- [ ] Documentation updated with mode behavior
- [ ] QA sign-off on both platforms

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues found post-deployment:
1. Revert to previous build via app store console
2. Mode state in SharedPreferences/UserDefaults is backward compatible
3. Hotfix can be applied without data migration

## Success Metrics

- Zero crashes related to mode switching (Firebase Crashlytics)
- 95% of sessions start in Parent Mode (Analytics)
- Mode switch success rate > 99% (Custom event tracking)
- Time to first photo add < 2 minutes (Funnel analysis)

## Notes for Peer Reviewer

**Review Checklist**:
- [ ] Verify iOS KidsModeGalleryView is properly integrated (not placeholder)
- [ ] Confirm Android default mode is PARENT not KIDS
- [ ] Test rapid mode switching doesn't cause race conditions
- [ ] Verify z-index/layering of all UI elements
- [ ] Check for memory leaks during mode transitions
- [ ] Validate state persistence across app lifecycle
- [ ] Ensure no hardcoded strings - all text localized
- [ ] Confirm haptic feedback on mode switch (if applicable)
- [ ] Test with VoiceOver/TalkBack enabled
- [ ] Verify no sensitive parent features accessible in Kids Mode

**Adversarial Test Cases**:
1. Try to access Settings in Kids Mode via deep link
2. Force-quit app during mode transition
3. Toggle airplane mode during PIN entry
4. Fill device storage and attempt mode switch
5. Attempt SQL injection in PIN field
6. Test with 100+ categories
7. Switch modes with 1000+ photos loaded
8. Test on minimum supported OS versions
9. Verify mode state with app restored from backup
10. Test with parental controls enabled on device

## Implementation Order

1. Fix Android default mode (simplest change)
2. Fix iOS Kids Mode view (unblock core functionality)
3. Ensure iOS Parent Mode navigation works
4. Align mode switching behavior
5. Add comprehensive tests
6. Performance optimization if needed
