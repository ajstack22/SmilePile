## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Overview
A mobile photo gallery application designed to help children independently access curated collections of calming images organized by category. The app focuses on intentional photo curation rather than displaying all device photos, providing a controlled, distraction-free environment for self-regulation.

### 1.2 Primary Objective
Enable a child to independently browse calming photo collections on their tablet/phone without requiring parent assistance, particularly during moments of dysregulation.

### 1.3 Success Criteria
- Child can successfully navigate and use the app independently
- App provides consistent, reliable access to calming content
- Parent can easily manage and organize photo collections
- App performance remains smooth during extended use sessions

## 2. Business Context

### 2.1 Problem Statement
Children experiencing dysregulation often need to view specific calming images but require parent assistance to access them through traditional photo apps. This creates dependency and potential delays during critical moments when immediate access to calming content is needed.

### 2.2 Target Users
- **Primary User**: Child (age range to be specified) using tablet/phone for self-regulation
- **Secondary User**: Parent/caregiver managing photo collections

### 2.3 Use Cases
1. **Independent Access**: Child opens app and browses photos without assistance
2. **Category Exploration**: Child discovers new calming content through organized categories
3. **Content Management**: Parent adds new photos and organizes categories
4. **Extended Sessions**: Child uses app for extended periods during regulation
